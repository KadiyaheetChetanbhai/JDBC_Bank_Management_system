## Project Description

Welcome to Project [JDBC_Bank_Management_system]! This project is designed to manage data for customers and employees using a relational database. The project consists of several key components that are essential for data management and integrity.

## Table Structure

1. **Customer and Employee Tables:** This project includes tables for both customers and employees. These tables store essential information about individuals, such as their name, contact information, and other relevant details.

2. **Transaction Table:** A transaction table is included to record various transactions. Each transaction is timestamped with the date and time of occurrence. This table also supports the concepts of transaction rollback and commit, which ensures data integrity during the update process.

## Data Management

3. **Procedure for Name Updates:** To facilitate data updates, the project includes a stored procedure for updating names. This procedure can be executed to modify the name of a customer or an employee as needed.

4. **Automatic Data Synchronization:** Any updates made to the data are automatically reflected in the respective tables. This ensures that the data remains consistent and up-to-date at all times.

## Blog Integration

5. **Blog Feature:** This project goes beyond basic data management and includes a blog feature. Both customers and employees can use this feature to share their thoughts and experiences by adding photos to their posts.

## Security

6. **Prepared Statements for Security:** To enhance security and prevent SQL injection attacks, prepared statements are utilized throughout the project. Prepared statements are a crucial security measure that helps protect the database from malicious input.
